# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
A Jupyter Notebook using Python for exploring the sales data of a business, Dune, to generate insights that answer business questions.

Here, I analyse the company's sales data from the previous year and provide actionable insights and recommendations. This analysis will help identify areas of opportunity and inform future business decisions aimed at improving performance and increasing profitability.

To do this, the data is cleaned before different visualisations and statistical analysis are carried out.
